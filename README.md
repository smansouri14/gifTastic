### When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

### When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

### Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

### Add a new button by typing it in to the New Players Name bar. Then click the new button to get that players gifs.
